This is not your average productivity app. It's funny, effective, and spiritually optimized for real work — with poop jokes included. 🚽⏱️🧠⚡

## 🧠 What Is It?

Pooper is a **focus timer app** built with 🛠 Kotlin + Jetpack Compose using an MVI architecture and Room DB. It helps you break work into tasks, stay laser-focused, and earn breaks — like a productivity-based toilet break system 💩.
